          'to the 3D gaming era. The PlayStation was the first computer entertainment platform to ship over 100 million units, thanks to its powerful hardware, ' +
          'affordable pricing, and extensive library of games. ' +
          'It introduced a CD-ROM format that allowed for larger game sizes, better sound quality, and full-motion video, setting a new standard for game production. ' +

          'The PlayStation boasted a broad range of games, including genre-defining titles such as "Final Fantasy VII," "Metal Gear Solid," and "Resident Evil," ' +
          'which have inspired numerous sequels and adaptations. ' +
          'The PlayStation’s success established Sony as a major player in the gaming industry and laid the foundation for the PlayStation brand as future iterations. ' +
